  //1. Modular, reuseable code (often easier to read)
  //2. Reduce repeated code (makes code more concise)
  //What do they actually do? Manipulate collections (e.g. map, filter, fold, reduce...)

//numbersList.foldleft (0) (_+) this is the shorthand, worked with fold left well b ut with right not so much?

  //Pseudocode
  //Start with 0 so  0+1 = 1 so (acc = 1)
  //Then, (1,2) start with 1 so  1+2 = 3 so (acc = 3)
  //Then  (3,3) => 3+ 3 = 6 (acc = 6)
