//OPTIONS
//in HMRC - Option of a string eg for married person have the option to fill it in or not
//use the syntax "Option[type]"

//PIZZA TASK
//Lets think about our pizza restaurant again.
//If the customer doesnâ€™t specify their preferred crust, the restaurant will just give a classic crust by default.
//This is how we would change our case class:
//How to change a case clas to include and Option // case class Pizza (size: Int, crust: Option[String])

//This code uses a trait to define a common structure for different types of pizzas,
// while utilizing Scala's Option type to handle cases where a crust might or might
// not be specified.

  //make a trait so it is consumed in this file. Defines 2 properties
  //if they don't specify the crust they get the default, I wrap it in the option of a string
