 // Whatâ€™s the difference between an abstract class and a trait? Why might you use one over the other?

 //- A class can only inherit from one abstract class but can inherit from multiple traits
 //- Abstract classes can have constructor parameters whereas traits can't
 // If you need constructor parameters and want to define clear inheritance hierarchy, use abstract classes
 // If you need reusable code and want to apply it to a range of different uses, use a trait
 // If in doubt, use traits
